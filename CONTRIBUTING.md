# Contributing

For each class created, a JUnit test class should also be created by the author. 
Additionally, Javadoc comments must be added to all code.

## Commits

Each commit must have a clear, concise title and a description that outlines the changes 
made to the source code. This helps the team leader when it comes time to write their report.

## Code of Conduct

### Academic Integrity

In addition to our universityâ€™s academic integrity policies, our professor made sure 
to explicitly mention, in the 
[Project Rules](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~kim/cs151/contents/project/rules.html) document, 
that we must acknowledge any use of outside code in our corresponding source code.
