# Contributing

Tasks are created and check out using OpenProject at http://35.185.237.187.
For each class created, a JUnit test class should also be created by the author. 
Additionally, Javadoc comments must be added to all code.

## Commits

Each commit must have a clear, concise title and a description that outlines the changes 
made to the source code. This helps the team leader when it comes time to write their report.

## Code of Conduct

To avoid team members working on the same part of the project, check out a task before working on it. Indicate progression of the task and/or completion before ending your working session.

### Academic Integrity

In addition to our universityâ€™s academic integrity policies, our professor made sure 
to explicitly mention, in the 
[Project Rules](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~kim/cs151/contents/project/rules.html) document, 
that we must acknowledge any use of outside code in our corresponding source code.
